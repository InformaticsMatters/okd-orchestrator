1.  **Where's my OKD inventory file?**

    This can be found on the **Bastion**, in a cluster-specific directory
    under ``$OKD/openshift/inventories`` (where ``$OKD`` is the path
    to your okd-orchestrator project clone). For example, the inventory file
    for the *simple AWS* deployment is
    ``$OKD/openshift/inventories/simple-aws-frankfurt-3-9/inventory``.

    Remember that the inventory is auto-generated by the ``create``
    utility, any changes you make to it might be lost later.


1.  **Where's the source of the OKD inventory File?**

    The OKD inventory file is constructed by rendering `Jinja2`_ files
    and populating variables via the **Terraform** templating feature.
    The inventory is typically formed from two files, a ``.root`` and
    ``.tpl.j2``. Both can be found in a deployment-specific directory
    under ``$OKD/openshift/inventories``.

    The ``.root`` file is generally where OKD configuration variables
    are specified. The ``.tpl.j2`` is a rather complex file that
    is used to dynamically construct the list of nodes in the cluster.
