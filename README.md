## Using Sphinx and GitHub pages.

You can use Sphinx output for GitHub pages but you have to defeat GitHub
Pages' built-in behaviour first as it attempts to build documentation.
You don't need it to do that as Sphinx does that nicely. All you want is to
have GitHib host the pages generated by Sphinx.

1.  Put documentation source in `/docs/source`
2.  Ensure documentation is published to somewhere like `/docs/build/html`
3.  Add an empty `.nojekyll` to `/docs`
4.  Put an `index.html` in `/docs` that simply redirects to the Sphinx
    documentation. That file should just contain:
     
    \<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=./build/html/index.html" />

5.  Build the documentation from the `/docs` directory with `./make-docs.sh`
    (which simply executes `sphinx-build -b html source build/html`)
6.  Commit and push the documentation, including the build directory
    and its files
7.  Enable GitHub Pages in GitHub using the **Master Branch with docs** option

That's it!

## Keeping a fork synchronised

If you have forked this repository remember to keep it synchronised
if you want to keep up-to-date. With a fresh clone of the fork you can
accomplish this using the following command sequence: -

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/InformaticsMatters/okd-orchestrator.git
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git merge upstream/master

See GitHub's help on the topic in its [Syncing a fork] page.
