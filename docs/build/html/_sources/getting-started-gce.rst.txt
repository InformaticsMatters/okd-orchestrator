Getting Started with GCE
########################

Provider Environment Variables
==============================

A number of parameters are required by the orchestrator. These are
defined in a cloud-provider-specific *template* file in the ``provider-env``
directory.

Copy ``setenv-gce-template.sh`` as ``setenv.sh``. You'll be using this file
throughout this example.

Account Preparation
===================

You use different types of security credentials depending on how you
interact with GCE and, in order to use the orchestrator, you will need: -

-   A **GCE account** for the Compute Engine
-   A project-based **credentials file**, a JSON file provided by Google that
    allows the orchestrator to make programmatic calls to the GCE API
    on your behalf
-   An **SSH Key Pair** that you and the OKD Orchestrator can use to create
    and access GCE objects.

Account
^^^^^^^

If you do not have an **GCE Account** visit https://cloud.google.com where
you can sign-up.

Credentials File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SSH Key Pair
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can generate a key-pair that does not use a pass phrase for this example
using the ``ssh-keygen`` tool::

    $ ssh-keygen -f okdo-keypair -t rsa -b 2048 -N '' -C centos

The keypairs (a private ``okdo-keypair`` and public ``okdo-keypair.pub`` file)
should be present in the root of the orchestrator project, not in your
``.ssh`` directory.

You should then upload the public (``.pub``) part to your GCE account
under ``Compute Engine -> Metadata -> SSH Keys`` for the given project.

Place the name of the keypair in your ``setenv.sh``. The value
should replace the existing value for::

    TF_VAR_keypair_name


Building your Cluster
=====================

To build your cluster you will need to compile the base images for GCE
before create your cluster.

-  When you're ready, follow the instructions for AWS in the
   :doc:`compiling-machine-images` guide
-  With base images compiled, you're ready to create the OKD cluster,
   all of which is covered in the :doc:`creating-your-cluster` guide
