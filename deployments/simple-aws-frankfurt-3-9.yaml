  # The external IP address or domain-name of the Master node.
  # If not set the master public DNS will be used.
  # Whatever is used must provide a resolvable route to the master.
  # So, if you have a domain, ensure it's routed to the pre-allocated
  # public IP of the master (see cluster.master.fixed_ip_id).

    # leave this property empty.
