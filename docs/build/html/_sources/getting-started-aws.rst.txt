Getting Started with AWS
########################

Provider Environment Variables
==============================

A number of parameters are required by the orchestrator. These are
defined in a cloud-provider-specific *template* file in the ``provider-env``
directory.

Copy ``setenv-aws-template.sh`` as ``setenv.sh``. You'll be using this file
throughout this example.

Account Preparation
===================

You use different types of security credentials depending on how you
interact with AWS and, in order to use the orchestrator, you will need: -

-   An **AWS account** that allows you to sign in to the AWS Management Console
-   **API Access keys** that allow the orchestrator to make programmatic calls to
    the AWS API on your behalf
-   An **SSH Key Pair** that you and the OKD Orchestrator can use to create
    and access EC2 objects.

Account
^^^^^^^

If you do not have an **AWS Account** visit https://aws.amazon.com where you can
sign-up.

API Access Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Access Keys** and are described on the Amazon `Access Keys`_
page. You will need environment AWS-compliant environment variables defined::

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY
    AWS_SECRET_KEY

SSH Key Pair
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can generate a key-pair that does not use a pass phrase for this example
using the ``ssh-keygen`` tool::

    $ ssh-keygen -f okdo-keypair -t rsa -b 2048 -N '' -C okdo-keypair

The keypair should be present in the root of the orchestrator project,
not in your ``.ssh`` directory.

You should then upload the public (``.pub``) part to your AWS account.
You will need to upload the key-pair to each `region`_ that you intend to use.
Our example assumes you'll be deploying to **Frankfurt**.

Place the name of the keypair in your ``setenv.sh``. The value
should replace the existing value for::

    TF_VAR_keypair_name

Building your Cluster
=====================

To build your cluster you will need to compile the base images for AWS
before create your cluster.

-  When you're ready, follow the instructions for AWS in the
   :doc:`compiling-machine-images` guide
-  With base images compiled, you're ready to create the OKD cluster,
   all of which is covered in the :doc:`creating-your-cluster` guide
