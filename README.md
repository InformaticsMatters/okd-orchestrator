## Using Sphinx and GitHub pages.

You can use Sphinx output for GitHub pages but you have to defeat GitHub
Pages' built-in behaviour first as it attempts to build documentation.
You don't need it to do that as Sphinx does that nicely. All you want is to
have GitHib host the pages generated by Sphinx.

1.  Put documentation source in `/docs/source`
2.  Ensure documentation is published to somewhere like `/docs/build/html`
3.  Add an empty `.nojekyll` to `/docs`
4.  Put an `index.html` in `/docs` that simply redirects to the Sphinx
    documentation. That file should just contain:
     
    \<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=./build/html/index.html" />

5.  Build the documentation from the `/docs` directory, with something like
    `sphinx-build -b html source build/html`
6.  Enable GitHib Pages in GitHub using the **Master Branch with docs** option.

That's it!
