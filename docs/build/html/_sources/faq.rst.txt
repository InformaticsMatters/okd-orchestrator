1.  **Where's my OKD inventory file?**

    This can be found on the **Bastion**, in a cluster-specific directory
    under ``okd/inventories``. For example, the inventory file
    for the *simple AWS* deployment is ``okd/inventories/simple-aws-3-11/inventory``.

    Remember that the inventory is auto-generated by the ``create.py``
    utility, any changes you make to it might be lost later.


1.  **Where's the source of the OKD inventory File?**

    The OKD inventory file is constructed by rendering `Jinja2`_ template files
    and populating variables via the **Terraform** templating feature.
    The inventory is typically formed from two files, a ``.root`` and
    ``.tpl.j2``. Both can be found in a deployment-specific directory
    under ``okd/inventories``.

    For example, the inventory file templates for the *simple AWS* deployment
    can be found in ``okd/inventories/simple-aws-3-11``.

    The ``.root`` file is generally where OKD configuration variables
    are specified. The ``.tpl.j2`` is a rather complex file that
    is used to dynamically construct the list of nodes in the cluster.
